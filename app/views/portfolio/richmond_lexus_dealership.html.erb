		<p>The Richmond Lexus is a new construction project targeting LEED silver, located in Richmond, BC.  The building energy efficient design features include – a high performance envelope, variable air volume systems with variable speed drives, exhaust air heat recovery, demand controlled ventilation, and condensing water heaters for car wash process water.</p>
		
		<p>CES was hired to validate the Pender Suites design energy efficiency for LEED certification.  The modeling program eQUEST was used to create the energy models to validate the design efficiency relative to ASHRAE 90.1-1999. The analysis showed an annual energy cost reduction of 23% relative to the ASHRAE 90.1 baseline which corresponded to 2 points for EAc1 – Optimize Energy Performance.</p>
