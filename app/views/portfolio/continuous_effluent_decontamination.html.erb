		<p>The continuous effluent decontamination (CED) unit is “Steris” proprietary pre-engineered solution to decontaminating biologically hazardous waste. This process is advancement to conventional kill tank technology.

		<p>The CED technology is applied at the UBC Life Science Centre Containment Level 3 Laboratory.</p>
		
		<p>CES Engineering, working as the third party bio-containment consultant for UBC Facility Group, played a major role in implementation of this system. Our services for this project included:
			<ul>
				<li>Selection of appropriate decontamination technology based on project specific conditions and parameters. The work included analysis of the current waste decontamination market and industry as well as a number of proprietary technology solutions</li>
				<li>Assistance in preparation of the selected technology RFP documents</li>
				<li>Tender evaluations and vendor selection</li>
				<li>Shop drawings review and waste decontamination process customization to specific project requirements</li>
				<li>Factory acceptance tests witness, acceptance and deficiency reports (Finland)</li>
				<li>Site acceptance tests acceptance and validations</li>
				<li>Operator training and project record documentation assistance</li>
			</ul>
