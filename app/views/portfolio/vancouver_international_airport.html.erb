		<p>YVR Domestic Terminal Level 3 and 4 enhancements were completed in preparation for the Vancouver 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games.</p>

		<p>To accommodate new Hold Baggage Screening (HBS) equipment that scans the baggage that is to be carried in the cargo hold of aircraft, the Domestic Terminal was expanded, leaving space above the HBS open for development.
