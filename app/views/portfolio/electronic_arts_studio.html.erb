		<p>EA Arts Studio is the state-of-the-art complex that includes audio and video studios and the world’s largest motion capture studio. Completed in 2006, the Electronic Arts Phase II expansion project consists of three components (600-car underground parkade with a soccer field roof top, Studio – a new stand alone 5-storey 176,000 square feet building including open office areas, a basketball sized gymnasium, and other amenities and 26,400 square feet Motion Capture Studio). The Motion Capture studio is used to produce real life motion videos of characters created for specific video games. The Studio Building and Motion Capture Studio are interconnected mechanically with the common mechanical heating and cooling plant located in the Phase II Studio building. Energy saving features include an underground outdoor air intake tempering tunnel that takes advantage of the constant ground temperature and pre-tempers the supply air. A radiant cooling system decreases the building’s energy consumption by pre-cooling the concrete slabs. A heat-pump system provides cooling to the network and server rooms, while moving heat from one area of the building to another. </p>
