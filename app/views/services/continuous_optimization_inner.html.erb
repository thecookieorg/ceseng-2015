		<p>Continuous optimization addresses changes in facility occupancy, use, maintenance and repair. Periodic adjustments and reviews of building operating systems and procedures are essential for optimal energy efficiency and service provision. Continuous optimization is a dynamic process intended to facilitate the efficient operation of a previously commissioned building. It repeats many elements of the standard commissioning process over a longer time period and should shorten the time intervals between operation and equipment reviews.</p>

		<p>Continuous optimization incorporates the monitoring and analysis of building performance data generated by the building automation system, or other permanently installed metering equipment, to verify high-level building performance, occupant satisfaction, and the financial outcomes of capital investments.</p>

		<p>Continuous optimization is distinct from preventive maintenance. While preventive maintenance focuses on the individual equipment or building sub-system maintenance tasks continuous optimization emphasizes systems-wide approach making sure building systems operation are understood, monitored and optimized. </p>
